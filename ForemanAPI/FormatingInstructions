
1: turn the machines in the row on

2: Plug in the machine's ethernet sequentially

3: Have the automated script continually update the google sheet (should take around 4-5 seconds per machine)

(Note, the automated script will be able to descern between boxes so if we are pressed for time we could plug in the ethernet
in two different containers at a time and it will still work)

4: continue 2 and 3.
